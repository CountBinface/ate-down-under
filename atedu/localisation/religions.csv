southcrosser_DESC;
The Church of the Southern Cross emerged after a prophet somewhere in the australian interior was given a new bible by Our Saviour, the Gospel. After that the church grew in numbers and spread like wildfire, both through missionary work and war. \n The head of the church is the archbishop, who lives and rules Brisbane. However he is elected by a council of bishops. \n Though some claim the church is not christian due to their refusal of the trinity (instead choosing to replace it with a system of four different forms of God), the majority still says they are christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The religion blends aspects of several pre-existing denominations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
